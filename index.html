		<h1><strong><strong>Global Warming's Effects on Florida</strong></strong></h1>
		<p>Florida is a key region that will be heavily impacted by the negative effects of global warming. Already, the Sunshine State has been witness to some minor effects of climate change. If we do not do anything to solve this issue, within the next one hundred years or so, more extreme consequences could occur causing major devastation. Some of those consequences include, but are not limited to:</p>
		
		<h2><strong>Rise in Sea Level</strong></h2>
		<p>If greenhouse gases continue to be emitted without reduction, approximately eighty years from now, sea levels could rise anywhere from three to six feet. This is one of the foremost problems due to the Floridians living in the coastal communities are only five feet above the present sea level. Likewise, the rising sea levels could easily submerge the small islands of the Florida Keys. Additionally, the surrounding beaches, mangrove forests, and wetlands are too, in much danger.</p>

		<h2><strong>Storms</strong></h2>
		<p>Florida has already experienced a large increase in the number of hurricane it recieves each year. The title of Sunshine State is going to soon be inaccurate as global warming will create even more instense storms. Over twenty-five Atlantic storms occured in the year 2005 alone, four of which affected Florida. Drastic weather alterations can also mkae the dissolved carbon dioxide concertrations higher, futhermore affected the acidity of seawater.</p><br>

		<h2><strong>Marine Life</strong></h2>
		<h3><em>Coral Reefs</em></h3>
		<p>One form of marine life most at risk due to climate change are coral reefs. Coral bleaching is one of the damaging effects. An increase or decrease of water temperature can cause coral polyps to become stressed, thus creating a lose of algae. Without the algae to give it color, the coral turns white. In addition, the stress allows the coral to be less impervious to diseases and subsquently death.</p><br>

		<h3><em>Fish and Wildlife</em></h3>
		<p>As aforementioned, a great impact of global warming is a change in temperature. These changes can force certain species to migrate, to adapt, or for the unlucky few, to go extinct. Native Florida wildlife will no longer have a proper habitat that is appropriate for their kind. Even the reserved areas for specific species would too be affected. Moreover, the amount of seasonal fires could fluctuate, thus creating additional problems.</p><br>
